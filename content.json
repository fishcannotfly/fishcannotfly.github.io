Even if the paper submitted to INFOCOM is the second one I have written, I still have problems in: WHAT to write in Abstract and Intro; HOW to tell things clear for readers who are not familiar with the academic background. Therefore, I tend to summarize the experience of writing a scientific paper and hope to IMPROVE THE WRITING SKILLS both logically and linguistically.","tags":[{"name":"Academic","slug":"Academic","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/tags/Academic/"}]}]
